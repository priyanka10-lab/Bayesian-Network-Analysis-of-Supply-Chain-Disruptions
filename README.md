Bayesian Network Analysis of Supply Chain Disruptions: Assessing Risk and Mitigation Strategies

This project focuses on leveraging Bayesian Networks (BNs) to analyze and mitigate supply chain disruptions caused by various events. The goal is to assess the risk associated with these disruptions and develop effective mitigation strategies. The entire analysis is implemented using the PGMPY library, which provides a robust framework for probabilistic graphical models.

To begin, the project constructs the BN structure using the PC algorithm and HillClimbSearch techniques. These algorithms help identify the causal relationships between different variables and determine the most appropriate network structure for the given data. By capturing the dependencies and conditional relationships among variables, the BN model becomes a powerful tool for analyzing supply chain disruptions.

One of the primary focuses of the project is investigating the likelihood and levels of supply chain disruptions for specific events, such as natural disasters. By estimating prior conditional probability tables, the project quantifies the probability of disruptions occurring and assesses their potential severity.

Furthermore, the project evaluates the impact of high-level supply chain disruptions on various types of damage, including loss of profit, reputational damage, and loss of market share. By understanding the potential consequences of disruptions, stakeholders can prioritize and allocate resources effectively to minimize the overall damage.

The effectiveness of diversifying suppliers as a mitigation strategy is also assessed in the project. By analyzing the impact of different response levels, the project provides insights into how diversification can help mitigate the amount of damage experienced during supply chain disruptions. This analysis enables decision-makers to make informed choices about supplier diversification and risk management strategies.

Lastly, the project demonstrates proficiency in using PGMPY for supply chain risk analysis by showcasing its application in Bayesian Networks. The GitHub repository contains the implementation code, documentation, and examples that illustrate the step-by-step process of constructing the BN, estimating probabilities, analyzing disruptions, and evaluating mitigation strategies.

Overall, this project provides a comprehensive approach to supply chain risk analysis by leveraging Bayesian Networks. By combining probabilistic modeling with a powerful library like PGMPY, stakeholders can gain valuable insights into supply chain disruptions, assess risks, and develop effective strategies to minimize damage and improve resilience.
